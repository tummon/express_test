- Watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyDVvGmzTlo

### Server details
Nginx running on DigitalOcean Droplet  
IP: 188.166.150.158  

Using PM2 to run the express.js server.  
`pm2 start express_test.js`  
`pm2 status`  


### Reverse proxy  
GET to 188.166.150.158 is sent to app running on port 8080  
POST is only working straight to port 188.166.150.158:8080/input
